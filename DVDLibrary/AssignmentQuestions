How far have you progressed in this assignment?
    I have implemented the Spring Dependency Injection. 

What Roadblocks have I encountered?
    The only trouble I had with that part of this was in the applicationContext.xml
    file for the Unit Tests. I mislabelled a class name and it took me a while
    to figure that out.
    I took time during this assignment to work more on the exercise from Milestone III,
    involving lambdas and streams. I understand how they work, but the new menu I wrote
    for different types of lists still needs work.
What Help have I had so far? 
    I had asked previously about how lambdas work, and after having it explained on Slack 
    I gained a better understanding of lambdas and streams.
What Roadblocks, if any, remain?
    Well, I think my code can improve a great deal, especially the new list menu. 
    I think I can shrink the size of that switch statement down a little bit, 
    in particular. That said from what I have learned, code may almost always
    be simplified in some way. It is not exactly a roadblock, but I think more reading
    on the Spring website would be a good idea as well, as I did not read as much
    of what was there as I would have liked. 
Have there been any enlightening revelations that have come while working on
this assignment? If so, what did you learn?
    I learned, while trying to find my small error in my applicationContext.xml file,
    more about what those files do and what each type of tag means and relates to the rest
    of my code. As I had learned last milestone, I need to code everyday in some way.
    I plan to use the unit test exercises for milestone IV to do just that. Thought again today, I did not
    get to work on them, I will be taking those two unit tests a day.
