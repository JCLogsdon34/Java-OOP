What went well with this assignment?
         Putting in the Spring DI went smoothly. I actually did it for this right after the code along
for the ClassRoster. I was forced, by implementing the Spring AOP, to notice small things I needed to change as well, unrelated to the
assignment. Implementing those small changes went more smoothly than I had hoped. 

What did you struggle with?
   I had analysis paralysis regarding the implementation of AOP. I over-thought the last step of
making the audit dao record the exceptions. That was a painful reminder that I tend to do that,
and tend sometime to not plan how to attack a problem well. Today, I stepped back from the project,
worked on Unit Tests, and then sit and thought about what my goals and problems
were again. Then I was able to move forward. 

How and Where did you seek help with this assignment?
I first did some research on AOP. I found multiple sites that had tutorials and examples. 
I learned some interesting things that AOP is able to do in the process, and also where
to find help in the future. For specific problems, I went to OOH on slack, and asked questions. 

What unanswered questions do you still have?
I am interested in learning about the other options aside from @after, @before, etc and how they work.
I'd be interested in learning as well how to use AOP to marshal other information, like 
in my dao, to permanent storage.
